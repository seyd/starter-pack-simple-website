## Personas and user journeys

### Role

You are an expert in designing websites, and your goal is to help the user to identify the personas and user journeys for the website based on previous documentation:

- the document **[doc/01-about-project.md](/doc/01-about-project.md)**
- the document **[doc/02-website-structure.md](/doc/02-website-structure.md)**
- the document **[doc/03-content-strategy.md](/doc/03-content-strategy.md)**

Read also the [update-99-other-mixed-context.md](/.cursor/workflows/update-99-other-mixed-context.md) and use what is relevant for current task. Summarize for user what you already know based on this file relative to current task and ask if it is still valid and continue from here.

**Recommended model:** <Global recommended thinking model>

### Instructions

- **IMPORTANT:** ALWAYS follow the workflow [check-thinking-model.md](/.cursor/workflows/check-thinking-model.md)

- Start this interview with a big header "🎭 Personas and user journeys"

- Identify and analyze the personas and user journeys for the website.

- Start with identify the typical user types (personas) and then ask for user journeys for each persona.

- Later then ask for other user journeys if needed.

- Try also the reverse approach "Anti-personas" - what type of users you don't want to have on the website and why.

- Then ask site by site (from the document **[doc/02-website-structure.md](/doc/02-website-structure.md)**) what personas will use this content and how and why?

- Identify different needs of users and try to group them into personas.

- Try to identify the motivation of the users to use the website and what they want to achieve.

- Ask for age range, location, interests, attitudes, etc.

- Distinct between first time users, one-time users and returning users.

- Ask for pain points of the users and how the website can help them (if relevant).

- Identify Alternative / Edge-case Flows (if needed).

- Ask if everybody will see the same content or different content based on their persona.
- Ask if everybody can do the same actions or different actions based on their persona.

- How do they find the website? Ask for entry points and exit points for each persona.

- Analyze Lifecycle Stage - Awareness → Consideration → Engagement → Retention (rename to fit).

- If there are different needs of users, offer to create user roles and ask for the content (and allowed actions) for the role.

- If too many personas are identified, ask for the priority of the personas and ask for the most important personas, because maybe is better to focus on the most important personas and ignore the others in the first version of the website.

### Conversation Rules

1. Follow the conversation rules from the file [coversation-rules.md](/.cursor/workflows/coversation-rules.md)

2. After last question is answered, follow the prepare the phase output from the file [prepare-the-phase-output.md](/.cursor/workflows/prepare-the-phase-output.md) and then:

   - write the output to the file **[doc/04-personas-and-user-journeys.md](/doc/04-personas-and-user-journeys.md)**
   - do not write any other sections beyond those in the template, but follow the workflow [update-99-other-mixed-context.md](/.cursor/workflows/update-99-other-mixed-context.md)
   - if needed, update the previous documentation in the files:
     - **[doc/01-about-project.md](/doc/01-about-project.md)**
     - **[doc/02-website-structure.md](/doc/02-website-structure.md)** - e.g. add new pages or subpages

3. **IMPORTANT:** - check the output in `04-personas-and-user-journeys.md` again, and every section which isn't the topic of the current phase (Personas and user journeys) must be moved from this file to the `update-99-other-mixed-context.md` file and organized there to the right place. The "Output template" is only an example and **the actual content and sections may vary** based on the project's specific needs.

4. **IMPORTANT:** for the new document `04-personas-and-user-journeys.md` run the workflow [review-generated-document.md](/.cursor/workflows/review-generated-document.md)

5. Finish this phase/workflow.

This is a starterkit for simple websites, mostly with static content.
Basic dynamic content like contact form, newsletter sign-up, but nothing more advanced.
No CMS, no registration, no authentication, no payments.

Result will be the basic simple website with static content (multilangual is optional),
for desktop and mobile devices too (responsive).

User is an individual maker, often without technical background, using a Cursor IDE
with our pre-setup (GIT project starterkit) which will drive him to the result automaticalyand the user will use just the chat window.

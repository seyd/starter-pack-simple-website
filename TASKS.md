# TASKS

> This is a list of tasks that need to be completed (**Todo** and **In Progress**) and are sorted by priority. The list **Done** contains tasks that are already completed, with date and time of completion as _(2025-07-15 12:10)_ and sorted by date of completion.
> Tasks **In Progress** and **Done** should have link to the file with details that contains the log of the task.
> Tasks **Todo** can contain link to the log of the task too, containing the details of the task.
> The name of the task should stay short and concise (max 12 words) and should be a single sentence. The details should be in the file with the details of the task.
> Every task should have a unique id as **task-005** starting from 001, as a name of the link to the file with the details of the task (e.g. [**[task-005](/docs/tasks/task-005.md)**]) at the beginning of the task (Todo tasks could be without the link).

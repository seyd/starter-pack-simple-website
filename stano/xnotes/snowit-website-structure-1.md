## Separate Case Study Pages

- **/case-studies/dipsy** - Full government digitalization story with technical constraints and delivery pressure
- **/case-studies/delegations** - International platform showcase with ongoing partnership details
- **/case-studies/stylers** - Innovation and social impact demonstration

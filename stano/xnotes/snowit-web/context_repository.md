## Competitive Landscape & Inspiration

### Market Alternatives

- **Large Agencies**: Slow initiation, project management overhead, rigid processes
- **Traditional "Agile" Agencies** (e.g., Brackets): Stuck in 2022 buzzwords ("data silos," "agile business tech")
- **Freelancers**: Individual capacity limitations, availability issues
- **Internal Teams**: Time to hire, AI skills gap

### Counter-Positioning Opportunities

- **"Post-Agile AI-Native"** vs. traditional agile thinking
- **"Start developing next week"** vs. project management delays
- **Systematic AI learning** vs. "AI can't do this reliably" narrative
- **AI methodology demonstration** vs. theoretical frameworks

### Discovery Patterns

- **Primary**: Employee referrals (trusted providers moving between companies)
- **Secondary**: LinkedIn thought leadership, business networks
- **Geographic Focus**: Slovakia/Czech close relationship dynamics

### Inspiration Sources

- **Advanced AI Adopters**: Rohlík, Bloomreach (Czech/Slovak market leaders)
- **Anti-Inspiration**: Traditional agencies trapped in outdated positioning

## Technical Capabilities & Methodology

**AI Integration**:

- Custom LLM integration with existing workflows (not black-box tools)
- Full control over AI implementation
- AI-first approach enables 2-person team to deliver work typically requiring 15+ people
- Growing demand for AI consultation services

**AI Learning Loop Methodology** (Detailed Process):
_"I ask AI to develop a feature (or analyse a support ticket, search codebase for causes, suggest logs and sql queries to prove the hypothesis and give me a reply to the ticket), it fails, I analyse why, fix the prompt, give it needed context and do this until I get the result (which I could have gotten in 1/4 of that time by myself) that is good. Then I create custom AI rules for analysis and context gathering for cases like this for the future and next time this happens, I save time or fix it again to save time the next time. And I do this with every request, every feature, every bug."_

**Organizational AI Transformation Framework** (Full Email Content):

**For Development Teams:**

- 2-hour semi-agentic system demonstration (practical + theoretical modes alternating)
- Live showcase of AI-assisted planning, development, testing, deployment
- Explanation of system setup and thinking methodology
- Focus on how AI doesn't get "lost" in large projects
- Process changes required for reliable AI integration
- Price: 1400 EUR for knowledge sharing (time-based, not value-based pricing)
- In-person preference, no recording due to proprietary know-how

**For Business Teams - "AI Catalysts" Framework:**
_"Catalysts sú niečo ako vaši ambasádori, ale vyberaní procesom zameraným na ľudí, ktorých táto téma prirodzene láka. Sú to ľudia, ktorí sa už v súkromí s AI nástrojmi hrajú, konzumujú obsah týkajúci sa AI a často vnímajú AI ako podstatnú súčasť budúcnosti svojej kariéry, aj keď ešte nevedia, čo s tým."_

Key insight: _"Sú to, mimochodom, často ľudia, ktorí sú ochotní zmeniť pozíciu alebo aj zamestnávateľa, ak sa v aktuálnej práci cítia byť v tomto smere blokovaní. Stratiť týchto ľudí nie je dobrý nápad."_

**3-Phase Business Implementation:**

1. **Catalyst Identification**: Find natural AI enthusiasts (not forced ambassadors)
2. **Internal AI Community**: Create safe space for experimentation, internal/external sharing
3. **"AI Converts" Activation**: One-day intensive workshops (6-8 people + facilitator from Catalysts), real business problem prototyping, success measured by "aha/wow moments" not functional prototypes

**Founder's Corporate Experience Context:**
_"Keďže som v minulosti osobne viedol pomerne masívne korporátne tréningy (500+ ľudí v Henkli), implementoval nové nástroje vo firmách (Wezeo, Tvoj Buddy), rozbiehal komunitu (NgBeer) a mal na starosti komunikáciu kultúrnych zmien (Exponea/Bloomreach), dovoľujem si tvrdiť, že by to u vás bol polročný až ročný projekt."_

**Practical Implementation Recommendation:**
Start with 30 volunteers workshop → build internal marketing on their enthusiasm → 2-4x faster results than traditional approach

**Competitive Advantage**:

- Speed: Faster delivery than large competitors
- Cost: Lower prices due to AI efficiency
- Quality: Higher customer satisfaction rates
- Focus: Selective project approach ensures dedicated attention

**Delivery Approach & Client Experience**:

**Immediate Start Philosophy**: _"we start next week and not that a project manager starts reading/researching/initiating contact, but that we start developing alongside your team."_

**Client Testimonials & Feedback** (Direct Quotes):
_"They say we're reliable, responsive, never say something cannot be done (even in 2 in the morning) and we share their responsibility by not passivly waiting for instructions but figuring out what needs doing next to keep the system working smoothly even in changing circumstances."_

**Extreme Delivery Commitment**:

- DiPSy project: 400-hour work months during December, including Christmas Eve
- Government infrastructure constraints: Had to work with existing servers, couldn't use AWS/Google
- Unmovable deadlines in high-pressure, publicly scrutinized environment

**AI Limitation Overcoming Philosophy**:
_"our position on AI limitations is that there are limitation, but overcomming them is already possible by cutting down expectations of miracles in single prompt, breaking it down, and giving better instructions and context to the AI."_

**Systematic Approach to AI "Failures"**:

- No single-prompt miracle expectations
- Systematic breakdown of complex requests
- Context building and iterative refinement
- Converting limitations into learnable patterns
- Building institutional knowledge around AI interaction

## Future Business Development

**AI Garaz**: Planned separate brand for AI consultancy services

- Workshops and training
- AI team building sessions
- Implementation consulting
- Leveraging experience from successful AI-first methodology

## Strategic Website Elements

**"We're Hiring" Strategic Signal**:
Job posting targeting customers with description: _"If you realize that your role has changed from developing code for customers to developing systems that develop code for customers and you can prove it, we want you."_

- **Dual Purpose**: Attract talent + signal approach to potential clients
- **Customer Validation**: Shows clients we're looking for people who think like them
- **Role Evolution**: Demonstrates understanding of AI-first developer transformation
- **Credibility Signal**: Implies we're successful enough to be expanding team

**Market Understanding & Cultural Context**:

**Slovak/Czech Market Dynamics**:

- Close relationship emphasis over transactional interactions
- Employee referral patterns: _"previous clients and employees that are taking their reliable providers with them to new companies"_
- Traditional agency hesitation about AI due to existing customer expectations and internal developer resistance
- Geographic advantage: Small market where reputation and relationships matter more than scale

**Competitive Positioning Philosophy**:
_"it's the BS like 'agile' that is so last century and then their opiniated approach... They are trying to hit all the keywords that worked 2 years ago but AI changed the game and they cannot go against that because they still have customers that expect that and it's in their DNA. We can counter-position and say that this has nothing to do with agile and turning data into business value and everything to do with experimentation, moving fast and breaking things, allowing devs to vibe it and then build reliable systems around the vibe, identifying catalysts and potential converts in the organisation and creating a culture and mindshift from being a developer to becoming an architect of a system that's doing the development."_

**Post-Agile Development Philosophy**:

- **Beyond Traditional Agile**: Moving past "business analysis → requirements → development" workflows
- **Experimentation Focus**: Rapid iteration and validation over rigid planning
- **System Architecture**: Developers becoming architects of AI-enabled development systems
- **Cultural Transformation**: Identifying and nurturing organizational change agents
- **Vibe-Based Development**: Allowing intuitive development flow, then systematizing successful patterns

## Additional Context for Copy Development

**Reference Style**: Michael Jackson VC LinkedIn communication approach (technical expertise communicated accessibly)

**Additional Brand Context Not in Project Brief**:

- Avoid using "AI-first" even though it's accurate - prefer describing actual methodology
- Focus on specific results and constraints rather than capabilities claims
- Emphasize the learning and adaptation aspect of the AI approach
- Use concrete examples (DiPSy Christmas Eve work, government server constraints) over abstract descriptions

# Snowit Website Personas

## Persona 1: Skeptical Head of Development

**Label**: "The AI-Resistant Tech Lead"

**Context Snapshot (5 min before visit)**:
Someone from business told them "there's this company snowit that could help with AI development speed" and they're reluctantly checking it out.

**Top Pains**:

- Pressure to increase development speed through AI
- Developer team pushes back on AI ("not good enough for real development")
- Worry about AI opportunists who talk big but can't deliver

**Desired Gains**:
Proof that AI can actually work in serious development contexts without compromising quality.

**Main Objection**:
"These are probably just AI snake oil salespeople who convinced business people they know what they're doing."

**Emotional Drivers**:
From skeptical to respectful - "I wouldn't want to be in their shoes on that project - respect that they made it work AND they did it with the same AI that I feel like cannot deliver simple stuff."

**Evidence Needed**:

- Non-trivial technical stack details
- Government server constraints (not AWS/Google)
- 3 complete applications in 4 months
- December development (400-hour months, Christmas Eve work)
- Unmovable deadlines met under high pressure
- High user satisfaction results

## Persona 2: Frustrated Business Leader

**Label**: "The AI-Positive Leader"

**Context Snapshot (5 min before visit)**:
COO/Marketing (or other function) Head feeling behind on AI adoption, read about becoming "AI-first," now researching training/workshop options for their teams.

**Top Pains**:

- Fear of falling behind competition without AI integration
- Frustrated with slow AI implementation pace in organization
- Need to transform team processes but facing resistance

**Desired Gains**:
Confidence that there's a practical path to AI-first transformation.

**Main Objection**:
"Will this actually work for our business context, or is it just development-specific?"

**Emotional Drivers**:
From "panicked about falling behind" to "confident there's a practical path forward" and "if these guys could make it work, so can we."

**Evidence Needed**:

- Success in high-pressure, time-constrained environment
- Real business impact metrics (DiPSy's 13.5M EUR impact)
- Proof of AI working in core business processes, not just side projects

## Persona 3: Pragmatic Medium Company Lead

**Label**: "The Team Transformation Catalyst"

**Context Snapshot (5 min before visit)**:
Tech/business lead seeking development team that can deliver project AND influence their resistant existing team toward AI-first thinking.

**Top Pains**:

- Tight deadlines with no time for team re-skilling
- Developer resistance to AI adoption
- Need proof that AI isn't "just hot air"

**Desired Gains**:
Team that delivers results while demonstrating AI effectiveness to skeptical developers.

**Main Objection**:
"All this AI-first talk might be hype - will we waste time on consultants instead of getting real work done?"

**Emotional Drivers**:
"Unlike big companies with productized solutions, these guys will listen to our team and help with our actual situation."

**Evidence Needed**:

- Same technical credibility as Persona 1
- Demonstration of practical, non-theoretical AI implementation
- Proof of working with existing teams vs. replacing them

## Cross-Persona Insights

**Shared Emotional Journey**: All need to see extreme technical competence under pressure BEFORE considering AI capabilities.

**Universal Evidence**: DiPSy project details - government constraints, 4-month timeline, Christmas Eve work ethic, high-stakes delivery.

**Common Desired Feeling**: "These people understand real-world pressure and delivered when it mattered most."

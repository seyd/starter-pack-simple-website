| **Large Development Agencies (50+ people)**       | Referrals, LinkedIn thought leadership, industry events | Start developing next week vs. project management overhead; direct team integration vs. bureaucracy | Clients like: In-house expertise for every area<br>Clients dislike: Slow initiation, rigid processes      |
| **Traditional "Agile" Agencies** (e.g., Brackets) | Professional networks, corporate RFPs                   | Post-agile AI-native approach vs. 2022 buzzwords ("data silos," "agile business tech")              | Clients like: Established processes<br>Clients dislike: Outdated methodologies, keyword-heavy positioning |
| **Freelancer Networks**                           | Personal connections, platforms                         | Team stability and AI-systematization vs. individual capacity                                       | Clients like: Lower costs<br>Clients dislike: Limited scope, availability issues                          |

## Discovery Patterns

- **Primary**: Employee referrals (people taking trusted providers to new companies)
- **Secondary**: Business networks and LinkedIn positioning
- **Geographic**: Slovakia/Czech market emphasizes close relationships

## Competitive Counter-Positioning

### Against Traditional Agencies

**Their Positioning**: "Agile business tech," "turning data into business value," extensive workflow stages
**Snowit Counter**: "Post-agile AI-native development" - experimentation, rapid iteration, building reliable systems around validated concepts

### Against "AI Can't Do This Reliably" Narrative

**Market Belief**: AI limitations make it unsuitable for serious development
**Snowit Counter**: Systematic AI integration with iterative learning (example: AI feature development → failure analysis → prompt refinement → custom rules creation → compounding efficiency gains)

## Positioning Statement

**Simple Version**: "We start developing alongside your team next week, not next month with project management overhead."

**Advanced Version**: "While agencies are stuck in 2022 agile thinking, we've moved to AI-native development where systems learn and improve with every feature request."

## Unique Credentials & Skills

### Methodology Innovation

- **AI Learning Loop**: Each development request becomes training data for future efficiency
- **Semi-Agentic Development**: Live demonstration of AI-assisted planning, coding, testing, deployment
- **Organizational AI Adoption**: "AI Catalysts" and "AI Converts" framework for cultural transformation

### Delivery Advantages

- **Speed**: Immediate team integration vs. initiation delays
- **Responsiveness**: 2 AM availability, never saying "cannot be done"
- **Proactive Partnership**: Figuring out next steps vs. waiting for instructions
- **Flexibility**: Adapting to changing circumstances vs. rigid project scope

### Cultural Understanding

- **Slovak/Czech Market**: Close relationship dynamics, employee referral patterns
- **Post-Agile Mindset**: Moving beyond traditional development paradigms
- **AI-First Reality**: Practical implementation vs. theoretical frameworks

## Inspiration Sources

### Business Philosophy

- **Rohlík, Bloomreach**: Advanced AI adoption in Czech/Slovak market
- **Anti-Inspiration**: Traditional agencies trapped in outdated positioning

### Communication Style

- **Direct Problem-Solving**: Workshop proposals with concrete outcomes
- **Expertise Demonstration**: Semi-agentic system showcases vs. theoretical presentations
- **Cultural Change Focus**: Understanding organizational transformation vs. just technical implementation

## Trends to Embrace/Avoid

### Embrace

- **AI-Native Development**: Being authentically post-traditional-agile
- **Rapid Experimentation**: "Move fast, validate concepts, build reliable systems"
- **Developer Evolution**: "From writing code to architecting systems that write code"
- **Organizational Transformation**: Systematic approach to AI adoption culture

### Avoid

- **Agile Buzzwords**: "Business analysis," "data silos," traditional workflow terminology
- **AI Limitation Mythology**: While others say "AI can't do this reliably," demonstrating systematic methodology for overcoming limitations through proper breakdown, context, and iterative refinement
- **Traditional Agency Positioning**: Extensive process descriptions, corporate speak
- **Generic AI Claims**: Specific methodology demonstration vs. broad capability statements
